# Data Guide

We've put together this Data Guide and Open Data Table to contextualise the different datasets provided for the Lab.

### Open Data Table
The Open Data Table details the name of the dataset, a brief description of its contents, a source link and the file type. You can find out more information (metadata, licensing etc) by following the source links of each dataset.

Dataset | Description | Source | File Type |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
[LT_615.xls](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/LT_615.xls) | The DCLG collects empty property data from council tax records for each local authority in England. This open dataset contains empty housing data from 2004 to 2015 although we're mainly interested in long-term empty housing | [DCLG via Data.Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants) | .xls (Excel Spreadsheet) |
[NLUD_sites_2012.csv](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/NLUD_sites_2012.csv) | The National Land Use Database of Previously Developed Land (NLUD-PDL) collects data on vacant sites. This dataset contains information about individual properties and their status from roughly 45% of local authorities in England, 2012 | [NLUD via Data.Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-land-use-database-of-previously-developed-land-nlud-pdl) | .csv (Comma Separated Values) |
[indices_deprivation_london_2015.xls](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/indices_deprivation_london_2015.xls) | Deprivation data for London at LSOA and local authority level, 2015. It takes into account a number of factors such as health, poverty and population | [DCLG via London Datastore](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/indices-of-deprivation-2015) | .xls (Excel Spreadsheet) |
[indices_deprivation_london_2010.xls](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/indices_of_deprivation_london_2010.xls) | Deprivation data for London at LSOA and local authority level, 2010. It takes into account a number of factors such as health, poverty and population | [DCLG via London Datastore](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/indices-deprivation-2010) | .xls (Excel Spreadsheet) |
[long_term_empties_london.csv](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/long_term_empties_london.csv) | This is an extract from the above LT_615.xls file, containing the total number of long-term empty properties in London's local authorities, 2004-2015 | [DCLG via Data.Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants) | .csv (Comma Separated Values) |

### Summary
Hopefully this guide will make things more straightforward for you. If you're just starting to pick up new data skills it can all seem a bit overwhelming. Student Data Labs will also be providing more guidance on using open data for cleaning, analysis and visualisation.

Including added information about datasets is a hallmark of good open data publishing. [Data Mill North](https://datamillnorth.org/), an open data platform based in Leeds, is a great example of local open data publishing in action.
