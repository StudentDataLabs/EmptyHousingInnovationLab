# Data Guide

We've put together this Data Guide and Open Data Table to contextualise the different datasets provided for the Empty Housing Lab. The open data here represents some of the most relevant and current data on empty housing.

### Open Data Table
The Open Data Table details the name of the dataset, a brief description of its contents, a source link and the file type. You can find out more information - metadata, licensing and so on - by following the source links.

Dataset | Description | Source | File Type |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
[LT_615.xls](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/LT_615.xls) | The DCLG collects empty property data from council tax records for each local authority in England. This open dataset contains empty housing data from 2004 to 2015 although we're mainly interested in long-term empty housing | [DCLG via Data.Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants) | .xls (Excel Spreadsheet) |
[indices_deprivation_london_2015.xls](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/indices_deprivation_london_2015.xls) | Deprivation data for London at LSOA and local authority level, 2015. It takes into account a number of factors such as health, poverty and population | [DCLG via London Datastore](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/indices-of-deprivation-2015) | .xls (Excel Spreadsheet) |
[long_term_empties_london.csv](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/long_term_empties_london.csv) | This is an extract from the above LT_615.xls file, containing the total number of long-term empty properties in London's local authorities, 2004-2015 | [DCLG via Data.Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants) | .csv (Comma Separated Values) |

### Summary
This guide is intended to help you work with empty housing open data. Student Data Labs will also be providing more guidance on using open data for cleaning, analysis and visualisation during the Empty Housing Lab.
