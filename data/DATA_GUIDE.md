# Data Guide

We've put together this Open Data Guide and Open Data Table to contextualise the different datasets provided for both the Data Workshop and the Innovation Lab of the Empty Housing Lab. The open data here represents some of the most relevant and current data on empty housing. We have combined a number of different open datasets here.

The Open Data Table details the name of the dataset, a brief description of its contents, a source link and the file type. You can find out more information - metadata, licensing and so on - by following the source links.

### Data Workshop
The data-workshop folder contains open data that will form part of the of the Data Workshop. The two open datasets below will be used in the on data exploration and modelling with R. The workshop on choropleth mapping with QGIS will require you to download open data - including geographic boundary files - from the Empty Housing Lab QGIS Mapping [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/446pg6rxdao1o2u/AAA7aGhH5zL35JA1k_rKnRSVa?dl=0).

Dataset | Description | Source | File Type |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
[long_term_empty_2015.csv](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/long_term_empties_london.csv) | This is an extract from the LT_615.xls file, containing the total number of long-term empty properties in London's local authorities, 2004-2015. It has been cleaned and reformatted in preparation for the Lab | [DCLG via Data.Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants) | .csv (Comma Separated Values) |
[empty_deprivation_2015.csv](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/data-workshop/empty_deprivation_2015.csv) | Combines the Indices of Deprivation 2015 at local authority level with percentages of empty and long-term empty housing. Cleaned and reformatted for the Lab | [DCLG via London Datastore](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/indices-of-deprivation-2015) | .csv (Comma Separated Values) |

### Innovation Lab
The Innovation Lab will make use of a variety of open datasets. Below are a few useful resources. The table will be updated continually to reflect new developments.

Dataset | Description | Source | File Type |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
[LT_615.xls](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/LT_615.xls) | The DCLG collects empty property data from council tax records for each local authority in England. This open dataset contains empty housing data from 2004 to 2015 although we're mainly interested in long-term empty housing | [DCLG via Data.Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants) | .xls (Excel Spreadsheet) |
[indices_deprivation_london_2015.xls](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/indices_deprivation_london_2015.xls) | Deprivation data for London at LSOA and local authority level, 2015. It takes into account a series of deprivation measures | [DCLG via London Datastore](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/indices-of-deprivation-2015) | .xls (Excel Spreadsheet) |

## Summary
This guide is intended to help you work with empty housing open data. Student Data Labs will also be providing more guidance on using open data for cleaning, analysis and visualisation during the Empty Housing Lab.
