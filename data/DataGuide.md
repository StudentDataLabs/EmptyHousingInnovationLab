# Data Guide

If you're just starting to pick up data skills it can seem a bit overwhelming. We've put together this Data Guide and Open Data Table to contextualise the different datasets contained in this folder.

### Open Data Table
The Open Data Table details the name of the dataset, a description of its contents, a source link and file type

Dataset | Description | Source | File Type |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
[LT_615.xls](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/LT_615.xls) | The DCLG collects empty property data from council tax records for each local authority in England. This open dataset contains empty housing data from 2004 to 2015 although we're mainly interested in long-term empty housing | [DCLG via Data.Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants) | .xls (Excel) |
[long_term_empties_london.csv](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/blob/master/data/long_term_empties_london.csv) | This is an extract from the above LT_615.xls file, containing the total number of long-term empty properties in London's local authorities, 2004-2015 | [DCLG via Data.Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants) | .csv (Comma Separated Values) |

### Summary
The Open Data Table hopefully gives more context to the data we have provided for the Lab. Hopefully it will make things more straightforward for you. Student Data Labs will provide more guidance on using open data in the Empty Housing Lab.

Providing added information about datasets is a hallmark of good open data publishing. You can find more - metadata, licensing, previews and other information - by following the source links. GOV.UK has published a [useful resource](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/open-data.html) on open data publishing.
