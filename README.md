Taking place on Saturday October 29th at the London campus of Liverpool University near the Barbican, the Empty Housing Innovation Lab is a [Student Data Labs](https://studentdatalabs.com) event. Free for all university students, the aim of the Lab is to explore how to address empty homes in London.

This page will provide you with information about the problem of empty housing in London as well as open data and learning resources for the Lab. Learning resources will be added closer to the event in late October.

### The Problem
Empty housing has a detrimental effect on local communities. While this is not the case for all vacant dwellings across the UK, it can be a major social, economic and environmental waste. Representing billions in monetary value, empty homes worsen the local living environment and drive down property prices. Despite falling numbers in many boroughs, thousands of properties remain empty across London.

A national campaigning charity that conducts research into vacant properties in England, [Empty Homes](http://www.emptyhomes.com/) has published a useful resource on the state of empty housing in 2016. The [report](http://www.emptyhomes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Empty-Homes-in-England-Final-September-2016.pdf) is essential reading for anyone interested in taking part in the Empty Housing Lab.

### The Empty Housing Lab, Saturday 29th October 2016
The Lab is split into two practical, project-driven sections: <b>Data Workshop</b> and an <b>Innovation Lab</b>. We'll also be having talks from researchers at UCL and the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC).

The short Data Workshop will focus on practical data skills in programming, analysis and data visualisation. The Innovation Lab will take a data-driven approach to tackling long-term vacant homes in London. Data Lab Volunteers will have the option to take part in the Data Workshop and the Innovation Lab.

Although students are encouraged to follow their own data projects, there will be a few key focus areas to guide the Lab:
+ How many empty homes are there in London and where are they located?
+ What is the value of empty housing in the city?
+ What other factors are related to empty housing in London's local authorities?

### Student Data Labs
Student Data Labs runs data-driven Innovation Labs for university students to learn practical data skills whilst working on civic problems. In the past, we have held Labs that tackle [road casualties](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/VisionZeroInnovationLab), and [health inequalities](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/HealthInnovationLab).
