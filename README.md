Taking place on Saturday October 29th at the London campus of Liverpool University near the Barbican, the Empty Housing Innovation Lab is a [Student Data Labs](https://studentdatalabs.com) event. Free for all university students, the aim of the Lab is to explore how to address empty homes in London. 

### The Problem
Empty housing has a detrimental effect on local communities. While this is not the case for all vacant dwellings across the UK, it's a major social, economic and environmental waste. Representing many billions in value, empty homes can worsen the local living environment and drive down property prices.

Despite falling numbers in many boroughs, thousands of properties remain empty across London. In 2015 there were <b>20,915</b> long-term empty homes in London according to open data from the [DCLG](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants). At 1,318 long-term empty homes, Newham is the worst performing borough in London followed by Kensington & Chelsea.

According to [PropertyRescue.org.uk](http://www.propertyrescue.co.uk/about-property-rescue/home-buyers-news/entryid/1158/empty-homes-in-england/), 78% of British adults believe that the government should do more to tackle empty homes. Bringing homelessness into the equation, Property Rescue goes on to state that "if empty homes were put back into use, there would be the equivalent of eleven homes per [homeless] person registered as being accepted as homeless and in priority need".

Another dimension of the <b>financial incentive</b> to finding empty housing in London for researchers. [You Spot Property](http://youspotproperty.com/) rewards those who spot empty homes in the city with a 1% stake in sold properties or a Â£20 voucher. We'll be exploring how to use data, GIS and analytics to find empty housing hotspots in London.

Empty Homes, a national campaigning charity, has recently published a report outlining some analysis of the current situation of empty housing in England. This [report](http://www.emptyhomes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Empty-Homes-in-England-Final-September-2016.pdf) is a great resource for those looking to put an empty home back on the market.

### The Empty Housing Lab, Saturday 29th October 2016
The Lab is split into two sections - a Data Workshop and an Innovation Lab. The short Data Workshop enables students to learn real-world data skills in areas such as data visualisation, open data and coding. The Innovation Lab is more experimental, drawing on a variety of disciplines to tackle long-term vacant homes in London. Data Lab Volunteers will have the option to take part in the Data Workshop or the Innovation Lab.

Here, you'll find [open data](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/tree/master/data) and learning resources for the Lab. Learning materials, which will focus on data visualisation, mapping, open data and coding with R, will be added closer to the event.

### Student Data Labs
Student Data Labs runs data-driven Innovation Labs for university students to learn practical data skills whilst working on civic problems. In the past, we have held Labs that tackle [road casualties](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/VisionZeroInnovationLab), and [health inequalities](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/HealthInnovationLab). 

Student Data Labs works with an interdisciplinary team of students, researchers, data scientists and developers. Although our work is multidisciplinary, our projects are ultimately driven by data. We also try to connect our Data Lab Volunteers with local organisations.
