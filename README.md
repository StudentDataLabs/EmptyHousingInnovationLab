### Event Info
Taking place on Saturday October 29th at the London campus of Liverpool University near the Barbican, the Empty Housing Innovation Lab is an event being organised by [Student Data Labs](studentdatalabs.com). Free for university students, the aim of the Lab is to explore how to address long-term empty homes in London. 

### The Problem
Despite falling numbers in many boroughs, there are thousands of long-term empty properties across London. 

In 2015 there were 20,915 long-term vacant homes in London according to Council Tax Base records. Long-term empty housing is defined as property that has been vacant for over 6 months.With 1,318 long-term empty homes, Newham is the worst performing borough in London followed by Kensington & Chelsea and Barnet. The Lab will focus on these three areas as well as the role of other factors such as economic activity and measures of deprivation.

Empty Homes, a national campaigning charity, has recently published a report outlining some analysis of the current situation of empty housing in England. This [report](http://www.emptyhomes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Empty-Homes-in-England-Final-September-2016.pdf) is a great resource containing more research info as well as policy and advice for those looking to put an empty home back on the market.

### The Empty Housing Lab, Saturday 29th October 2016
The Lab is split into two sections - a Data Workshop and an Innovation Lab. The workshop helps students learn real-world data skills such as data visualisation, open data and programming. The Innovation Lab will draw on multidisciplinary methods and develop data-driven tools to tackle long-term vacant homes. Data Lab Volunteers will have the option to take part in the workshop or the Lab before the two converge in the second part of the event.

Another dimension of the Innovation Lab is the <b>financial incentive</b> to finding empty housing in London. [You Spot Property](http://youspotproperty.com/) rewards those who spot empty homes in the city with a 1% stake in sold properties or a Â£20 voucher. We'll be exploring how to use data, GIS and analytics to find empty housing hotspots in London.

Here, you will find [data](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/tree/master/data) and resources for the Lab. Learning materials, which will focus on data visualisation, open data and programming in R, will be added closer to the event on Saturday 29th of October.

### Student Data Labs
Student Data Labs runs data-driven Innovation Labs for university students to learn practical data skills whilst working on civic problems. In the past, we have held Labs that tackle [road casualties](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/VisionZeroInnovationLab), and [health inequalities](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/HealthInnovationLab). 

Student Data Labs works with an interdisciplinary team of students, researchers, data scientists and developers. Although our work is multidisciplinary, our projects are ultimately driven by data. We also try to connect our Data Lab Volunteers with local organisations.
