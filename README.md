### Information
Taking place on Saturday October 29th at the London campus of Liverpool University near the Barbican, the Empty Housing Innovation Lab is an event being organised by Student Data Labs. Free for university students, the aim of the Lab is to explore how to address the issue of long-term empty properties in the city. 

### The Problem
Empty properties are a significant aspect of the housing crisis in London. Despite falling numbers in many boroughs, thousands of homes remain empty across London. 

Long-term empty housing is defined as property that has remained vacant for over 6 months. In 2015 there were 20,915 long-term vacant homes in London according to Council Tax Base records. With 1,318 long-term empty homes, Newham is the worst performing borough in London followed by Kensington & Chelsea and Barnet. The Lab will focus on these three areas.

The aim of the Empty Housing Innovation Lab is to use data to address this problem. While our work is truly multidisciplinary, our projects are driven by data.

### The Empty Housing Innovation Lab
The Lab is split into two sections - a Data Workshop and an Innovation Lab. The workshop helps students learn real-world data skills - learning about open data, data visualisation and programming for data science. The Innovation Lab is more experimental, where the aim is to draw on multidisciplinary ideas and develop data-driven tools to tackle civic problems.

Here, you will find [data](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/tree/master/data) and resources for the Lab. Learning materials, which will focus on data visualisation, open data and programming in R, will be added closer to the event.

### Student Data Labs
Student Data Labs runs data-driven Innovation Labs for university students to learn practical data skills whilst working on civic problems. In the past, we have held Labs that tackle Type 2 Diabetes and health inequalities in Leeds. Student Data Labs works with an interdisciplinary team of students, data scientists, designers, researchers and software developers. We also aim to connect our Data Lab Volunteers with local employers who may be interested in employing them upon graduation.
