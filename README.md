Taking place on Saturday October 29th at the London campus of Liverpool University near the Barbican, the Empty Housing Innovation Lab is a [Student Data Labs](https://studentdatalabs.com) event. Free for all university students, the aim of the Lab is to explore how to address empty homes in London.

This page will provide you with information about the problem of empty housing in London as well as open data and learning resources for the Lab.

### The Problem
Empty housing has a detrimental effect on local communities. While this is not the case for all vacant dwellings across the UK, it can be a major social, economic and environmental waste. Representing billions in monetary value, empty homes worsen the local living environment and drive down property prices.

Despite falling numbers in many boroughs, thousands of properties remain empty across London. In 2015 there were <b>20,915</b> long-term empty homes in London. We'll be exploring the data behind empty housing in London.

According to [PropertyRescue.org.uk](http://www.propertyrescue.co.uk/about-property-rescue/home-buyers-news/entryid/1158/empty-homes-in-england/), 78% of British adults believe that the government should do more to tackle empty homes. Bringing homelessness in England into the equation, Property Rescue goes on to state that "if empty homes were put back into use, there would be the equivalent of eleven homes per [homeless] person registered as being accepted as homeless and in priority need".

### The Empty Housing Lab, Saturday 29th October 2016
The Lab is split into two sections - a <b>Data Workshop</b> and an <b>Innovation Lab</b>. The Data Workshop will enable students to learn real-world data skills in areas like data visualisation, analysis and coding. The Innovation Lab is more experimental, drawing on a variety of disciplines to tackle long-term vacant homes. Data Lab Volunteers will have the option to take part in the Data Workshop and the Innovation Lab.

### Student Data Labs
Student Data Labs runs data-driven Innovation Labs for university students to learn practical data skills whilst working on civic problems. In the past, we have held Labs that tackle [road casualties](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/VisionZeroInnovationLab), and [health inequalities](https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/HealthInnovationLab).
